# Sample Data Generator for AWS IoT Simple Beer Service

This is the code repository for sample code to locally generate IoT device data similar to what is generated by the AWS Simple Beer Service devices, and feed it to AWS IoT service.

### Pre-requisites

* Amazon Web Services account
* [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Python
* boto3

### Script Details

The script generates random values (within a reasonable range) for each of the four parameters- Flow, Temperature, Humidity and Sound. You can tweak the values by changing the *random.randint(min, max)* values corresponding to each parameter. 

The script is set to generate messages of each of the four types in a fixed percentage. If you want more or less messages of a particular parameter, you can change the values of *rnd* in the *if...else* part of the code. 

### Running Example

`$ python sbs.py`
